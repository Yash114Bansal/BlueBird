### Core Services

| Service | Purpose | Key Features |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Auth Service** | Authentication & Authorization | JWT tokens, RBAC, OTP verification, session management |
| **Events Service** | Event Management | CRUD operations, caching, pub/sub notifications |
| **Bookings Service** | Booking & Availability | High-consistency bookings, waitlist, optimistic locking |
| **Analytics Service** | Analytics & Reporting | Real-time metrics, event-driven aggregation |
| **Email Workers** | Asynchronous Processing | Celery-based email notifications, background tasks |

### Technology Stack

- **Framework**: FastAPI (async, high-performance)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Cache**: Redis (caching, sessions, pub/sub, distributed locking)
- **Message Queue**: Celery with Redis broker
- **Authentication**: JWT with role-based access control
- **Secrets Management**: Zero SDK
- **Containerization**: Docker with health checks
- **Monitoring**: Structured logging, health endpoints

## üîó Service Communication

### Inter-Service Communication Patterns

1. **Asynchronous Pub/Sub**: Redis channels for event notifications
2. **Background Processing**: Celery tasks for non-blocking operations

### Communication Flow

```
Client ‚Üí Auth Service (JWT validation)
Client ‚Üí Events Service (browse events)
Client ‚Üí Bookings Service (create booking)
Events Service - Bookings Service (add published events)
Events Service ‚Üí Analytics Service (event metrics)
Bookings Service ‚Üí Analytics Service (booking metrics)
Bookings Service ‚Üí Email Workers (send notifications)
Auth Service -> Email Workers (send emails)
```

### Service-Specific Databases

Each service maintains its own PostgreSQL database with domain-specific models:

#### Auth Service
- **Users**: User accounts, roles, verification status
- **UserSessions**: Active sessions, security tracking

#### Events Service  
- **Events**: Event details, capacity, pricing, status

#### Bookings Service
- **Bookings**: Booking records with optimistic locking
- **BookingItems**: Individual booking line items
- **EventAvailability**: Real-time capacity tracking
- **WaitlistEntry**: Waitlist management
- **AuditLogs**: Complete audit trail

#### Analytics Service
- **EventStats**: Per-event aggregated metrics
- **DailyStats**: Time-series daily aggregates
- **TopEvents**: Pre-computed leaderboards
- **SystemMetrics**: System-wide KPIs
- **EventLog**: Event processing audit

## üéØ Major Design Decisions & Trade-offs

### 1. Microservices vs Monolith

**Decision**: Microservices architecture
**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Independent scaling, technology diversity, fault isolation, team autonomy
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Increased complexity, network latency, distributed data management
- **Rationale**: Event management has distinct domains (auth, events, bookings, analytics) that benefit from independent evolution

### 2. Database Per Service

**Decision**: Each service owns its database
**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Data isolation, independent schema evolution, service autonomy
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Cross-service queries require API calls, eventual consistency challenges
- **Rationale**: Strong domain boundaries enable independent scaling and reduce coupling

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture

**Decision**: Redis pub/sub for inter-service communication
**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Loose coupling, real-time updates, scalability
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Eventual consistency, message ordering challenges
- **Rationale**: Analytics and notifications can tolerate eventual consistency for better performance

### 4. Optimistic Locking for Bookings

**Decision**: Version-based optimistic locking in bookings
**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: High concurrency, better performance than pessimistic locking
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Retry logic required, potential for conflicts
- **Rationale**: Booking conflicts are rare, optimistic locking provides better user experience

### 5. Redis for Multiple Use Cases

**Decision**: Redis for caching, sessions, pub/sub, and distributed locking
**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Single technology, high performance, rich data structures
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Single point of failure, memory limitations
- **Rationale**: Redis provides excellent performance for all use cases

## üöÄ Scalability & Fault Tolerance

### Horizontal Scaling Strategy

1. **Stateless Services**: All services are stateless, enabling easy horizontal scaling
2. **Load Balancing**: Docker Compose with multiple replicas
3. **Database Scaling**: Read replicas and connection pooling
4. **Cache Scaling**: Redis clustering for high availability

### Fault Tolerance Mechanisms

1. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Automatic service degradation
2. **Health Checks**: Built-in health endpoints with dependency checks
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Services continue with reduced functionality
4. **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
5. **Distributed Locking**: Redis-based locks prevent race conditions
